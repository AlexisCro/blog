Currently undergoing a career change, 
I am a Ruby on Rails developer in a work-study program at SpendHQ while attending ISITECH. 

My career began as a laboratory technician, 
where I developed strong analytical skills and attention to detail. 
As an IT coordinator in a hospital laboratory, 
I successfully led two major projects, 
which deepened my interest in software development.

As part of my training, 
I am the project manager for <a href="https://www.casavin.fr/" target="_blank">CasaVin</a>, 
a SaaS tool developed with Ruby on Rails and Hotwire, 
created in collaboration with a three-person team.
